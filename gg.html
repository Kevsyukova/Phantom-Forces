        <div class="p1">class="c4 c5"><span class="c6">Grips </span><span class="c2">DO NOT</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;make a gun more
                accurate by manipulating bullet trajectory; instead they change the recoil to make shots generally travel
                where the player aims. Both of these facts mean that grips are usually obsolete on manual actions (bolt
                actions, pump actions, etc.), as they do not make the gun more accurate since the recoil will reset with
                each shot, and they make </span><span class="c6">equip</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and aim speeds worse.
                Grips should be used on weapons that fire in rapid succession, such as automatic rifles, to keep shots as
                close to the aimed point as possible and where the equip and aim speeds can be sacrificed, as most
                &nbsp;grips do not affect the first shot fired.</span></p>
        <div class="p1">class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>
        <div class="p1">class="c0"><span class="c9">VERTICAL GRIP</span></p>
        <div class="p1">class="c4 c5"><span class="c3">The vertical grip acts mostly to correct rotational recoil as opposed to camera
                recoil like most other grips do. This can make the weapon feel more unstable or harder to control, and when
                paired with the somewhat misleading description in-game, can lead many people to believe that it only exists
                for hipfire. While it is not the optimal choice for most weapons to aim with, it does prove effective on
                certain others.</span></p>
        <div class="p1">class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>
        <div class="p1">class="c4"><span class="c2">Positive effects include:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Decreased minimum and maximum
                rotational recoil values in both aiming and hipfire, improved hip fire spread damping, hip fire spread

        <div class="p1">class="c4"><span class="c2">Negative effects include:</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Increased minimum and maximum

        <div class="p1">class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>
        <div class="p1">class="c4 c5"><span class="c3">Generally the vertical grip stands to benefit weapons that visibly sway and rotate
                a lot, or weapons that have already low camera recoil and could become even more accurate with this grip.
                Weapons that focus on hip fire can also stand to benefit from this grip. Weapons that should not use this
                grip include ones that do not visibly sway around too much and follow the camera and/or are already harder
                to handle.</span></p>

        <div class="p1">class="c4 c5"><span class="c3">The angled grip is the cheapest camera recoil correcting grip. Its description
                focuses on its ability to help camera recoil while aiming, which is its strongest trait. Working somewhat
                like the opposite of the vertical grip, it focuses instead on correcting the camera recoil of a gun in both
                aiming and hip fire at the expense of rotational recoil.</span></p>
        <div class="p1">class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>

        <div class="p1">class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>
        <div class="p1">class="c4 c5"><span class="c3">While the angled grip does not have as many downsides as the vertical grip, it
                still faces problems and should be used with other grips in mind. For example, the folding grip is
                essentially just the angled grip, except it does everything to a more extreme degree. Stubby grip is also a
                significant competitor to the angled grip. The angled grip works best on weapons that benefit from camera
                recoil stabilization and can lose some rotational recoil accuracy at an expense, but cannot afford to lose
                as much accuracy as the folding grip makes them loose.</span></p>

        <div class="p1">class="c4 c5"><span class="c6">The folding grip is a very extreme grip in terms of its effects, but those effects
                can be very beneficial to certain weapons. Described as a grip that focuses on camera recoil, it certainly
                lives up to its description, having the greatest overall camera recoil reduction in both aiming and hipfire.
                However, this obviously comes at a price. Its rotational recoil addition is even higher than the angled
            </span><span class="c6">grip&rsquo;s</span><span class="c3">, making it a very poor choice on many weapons. In
                addition to this, it also makes hip fire spread damping worse, making it a poor hip fire choice, but given
                its impressive camera recoil improvement, it can also be a very worthwhile grip to use on many
                weapons.</span></p>
        <div class="p1">class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>
        <div class="p1">class="c4"><span class="c2">Positive effects include:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Substantially decreased

        <div class="p1">class="c4 c5"><span class="c3">The folding grip can turn many jumpy-recoil weapons into much more stable ones,
                often allowing many weapons to utilize their maximum potential at range. While one should consider how much
                rotational recoil they are adding, the effects of the folding grip are often quite obvious. This grip is
                suggested for jumpy, rough-handling weapons that are still accurate for the most part, as well as weapons
                that do not rotate very much but could benefit from some form of recoil reduction</span></p>

        <div class="p1">class="c4 c5"><span class="c3">The stubby grip has rather strange effects, but generally can be thought of as a
                grip focussed around improving aiming recoil. Its prime traits include its ability to reduce camera kick (in
                aiming only) to the same degree as the angled grip, but without any rotational recoil addition in both hip
                fire and aiming. Instead, the downsides of the stubby grip revolve around increasing the minimum recoil
                displacement stat in both hip fire and aiming, which is usually a better tradeoff than rotational recoil, as
                well as not helping camera recoil in hip fire and making hip fire generally worse.</span></p>
        <div class="p1">class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>
        <div class="p1">class="c4"><span class="c2">Positive effects include:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Decreased camera recoil while
                aiming, improved weapon recovery speed in hip fire and aiming, slightly lower hip fire spread factor.</span>
        </p>
        <div class="p1">class="c4"><span class="c2">Negative effects include:</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Increased minimum weapon

        <div class="p1">class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>
        <div class="p1">class="c4 c5"><span class="c3">The stubby grip acts as a very aiming-based sight, working as a direct competitor
                to the angled and folding grips, as it achieves the same camera recoil reduction while aiming without the
                rotational recoil addition. It also holds some value on ranged weapons, as it improves weapon recovery
                speed, although it must be used with the translational recoil and slower aim speeds in mind, and as a result
                is not recommended for things such as dmr&rsquo;s. Generally the stubby grip works best for weapons that do
                not have too much to correct or require only minimal camera recoil reduction in aiming while saving the
                rotational recoil. Stubby grip is also not a good choice for hip fire weapons.</span></p>

        <div class="p1">class="c4 c5"><span class="c3">The chainsaw grip is an oddity among grips: it completely removes any ability to
                aim with your weapon. It seems to function as more of a joke than a real grip, but it does have its
                uses&hellip; sort of. As it completely removes the ability to aim, it seeks to correct hip fire as much as
                it can, but instead of focussing on rotational, translational, or camera recoil, the chainsaw grip simply
                improves hip fire spread, recovery speed, and damping by significant margins. For those of you who want to
                be &ldquo;Pro No-Scope Clippers&rdquo;, here is a grip to help you not aim and get that 360 no-scope off the

                really be suggested or not advised on anything because it has no real downside except to remove aiming,
                which is the same on all guns. Snipers and dmr&rsquo;s could use this grip if the user really wanted to,

        <div class="p1">class="c4 c5"><span class="c3">The pistol grip serves much like the rival to the vertical grip, sharing many
                similar traits: both grips focus on correcting rotational recoil instead of camera recoil, as opposed to
                most other grips like stubby and folding, which correct camera recoil. From there, the pistol grip tries to
                gain its edge over the vertical grip in its aiming stability as opposed to its hip fire stability. The
                pistol grip helps rotational recoil and translational recoil in both hip fire and aiming, but helps
                significantly more in aiming. However, it also comes with a maximum camera kick penalty in both aiming and
                hipfire, with the hip fire penalty being greater than the aiming one. Generally speaking, the pistol grip
                works to correct translational and rotational recoil in aiming with a minor penalty to camera kick, but
                makes hip fire and initial kick noticeably worse at the same time.</span></p>
        <div class="p1">class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>
        <div class="p1">class="c4"><span class="c2">Positive effects include:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Improved rotational and

        <div class="p1">class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>
        <div class="p1">class="c4 c5"><span class="c3">The pistol grip is certainly a helpful grip, being the optimal choice for weapons
                needing rotational recoil assistance in aiming, while focussing the negative effects on hip fire as opposed
                to camera recoil (although camera recoil in aiming takes a small penalty as well). With its main competitor
                being the vertical grip, the pistol grip is a much better choice for those who want to aim primarily while
                correcting rotational/translational recoil. However, keep in mind that the vertical grip outclasses the
                pistol grip in nearly all areas in hipfire, so while the pistol grip is a better choice for aiming, the
                vertical grip makes both hip fire and aiming better (in cases where the weapon benefits from rotational
                help).</span></p>

                change how the user aims, but is more practical (sort of). The sideways grip adds an alternate aim option
                similar to that used on LMGs, where the user puts their weapon to the right of the screen and fires it
                without aiming down the sights (looks like firing a cannon mounted from your shoulder). The sideways grip
                also alters the recoil a little bit by making rotational recoil while aiming slightly better and making the
                max camera kick slightly worse in both hip fire and aiming, as well as slightly making the hip fire spread
                damping better. It is also unique in the sense that it has no effect on aim speed!</span></p>

                does come with a built-in flashlight! Aside from being a grip to replace flashlights, the potato grip is
                actually quite useful. Serving as a cross between the angled and stubby grips, the potato grip also attempts
                to correct camera recoil with minimal downside, and does a good job of it. While it may not offer the most
                camera recoil help possible, it does offer lots of it without hurting other stats very much at all.</span>

        <div class="p1">class="c4 c5"><span class="c3">The potato grip currently offers the same camera recoil reduction stats as the
                angled grip, but like the stubby grip it does not harm the weapon&rsquo;s rotational recoil. Instead, it
                focuses the downsides on translational recoil, much like the stubby grip. However, instead of hurting the
                minimum possible translational recoil, it hurts the maximum possible recoil to a slightly larger degree. As
                a result, it can be thought of as a competitor to both the angled and stubby grips, as it offers the same
                camera recoil reduction in both aiming and ads, with close to the same downsides in aiming as the stubby
                grip but without any downsides in hip fire (it actually improves hipfire!).</span></p>

        <div class="p1">class="c4 c5"><span class="c6">The skeleton grip is almost like a reverse grip: it chooses to sacrifice recoil
                for aim and </span><span class="c6">equip</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;speed, and is the only grip to do so
                as of now. Because of this, it is also the only grip to be legitimately useful to many manual actions such
                as sniper rifles, shotguns, etc. This also, however, makes it largely hurtful to guns that would normally
                benefit from grips. It can also be hurtful to semi-automatic weapons, as it hurts all damping, spread, and
                recovery stats, making weapons slower to recover from recoil and overall hurting them in hip fire and
                aiming. If your weapon resets completely between shots, the skeleton grip is generally a good pick.</span>

        <div class="p1">class="c4 c5"><span class="c3">The skeleton grip (as mentioned previously) works best on weapons that completely
                reset recoil between shots. Given the slower recovery speed for the weapon however, there is a risk that
                semi auto weapons like the M107 or DBV 12 might not benefit from this grip, as their overall fire rate could
                be hindered or made less accurate. Because of this, experimenting with semi auto weapons is not a bad idea
                before equipping this grip permanently on them.</span></p>

        <div class="p1">class="c4 c5"><span class="c3">The Romanian grip is an exclusive grip that can only be used on certain weapons
                such as the AK47 or Remington 870. Its main purpose is to improve hip fire by improving translational recoil
                and recovery stats. These improvements make the weapon&rsquo;s hip fire easier to manage, as the Romanian
                grip does not affect camera recoil stats like the vertical grip does. However, the Romanian grip does
                negatively affect rotational recoil, and to a substantial amount. It also hurts aiming speed even more than
                most other grips, making it a poor choice for manual actions or ranged weapons.</span></p>
        <div class="p1">class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>
        <div class="p1">class="c4"><span class="c2">Positive effects include:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Improved hip fire spread,
                recovery, and damping values, improved minimum translational recoil in hipfire, improved min and max
                translational recoil in aiming.</span></p>
        <div class="p1">class="c4"><span class="c2">Negative effects include:</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Worse rotational recoil in
                aiming and hipfire, slower </span><span class="c6">equip</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;speeds, even slower

        <div class="p1">class="c4 c5"><span class="c3">As the Romanian grip is not available on all weapons, the weapons it can help are
                very limited. The Romanian grip ends up being a competitor with the vertical grip for the title of best hip
                fire grip, but only for the certain weapons that can have it. It becomes useful on things like the AK47, as
                it has a naturally high camera recoil and suffers from the downsides of the vertical grip even more, but can
                afford the downsides the Romanian grip brings. Keep in mind that the Romanian grip is largely for hip fire
                and generally makes aiming recoil worse, and as such should be used with preference and caution.</span></p>

                only certain guns. Much like the Romanian grip, it is also slower to aim than other grips, but in the Hera
                grip&rsquo;s case, it is also slower to equip, making it even slower than the Romanian grip. However, the
                Hera grip has a built-in exclusive yellow laser! Aside from its unique laser, it also holds some unique
                stats. Working somewhat like a pistol grip with a free laser, the Hera grip improves rotational and
                translational recoil in both hip fire and aiming, at the cost of camera recoil in both, just like the pistol
                grip.</span></p>
        <div class="p1">class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>
        <div class="p1">class="c4"><span class="c2">Positive effects include:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Improved translational and
                rotational recoil (only improves max values in hipfire), slightly improved hip fire damping and weapon

        <div class="p1">class="c4"><span class="c2">Negative effects include:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Worse max camera recoil in hip
                fire and aiming, worse camera recovery speed, worse aiming walk speed, even slower aim and equip speeds than
                other grips.</span></p>
        <div class="p1">class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>
        <div class="p1">class="c4 c5"><span class="c3">With a very heavy set of pros and cons, the Hera grip should be used with careful
                consideration. While it does have the same camera recoil downsides as the pistol grip, it also makes the
                weapon handling generally slower than the pistol grip (or any other grip) does. So why use the Hera grip
                over the pistol grip? While the pistol grip may have better rotational and translational improvement in
                aiming, as well as not making recovery speeds worse, the Hera grip is able to accomplish close to the same
                goal while not making hip fire much worse (and in many cases improving the hipfire). Because the grip has an
                integrated laser, and because of its slow handling, the Hera grip acts like a pistol grip suited for
                hipfire, but not completely useless in aiming, offering a unique balance of the 2 forms of firing the
                weapon. In short, the Hera grip is good for weapons that need rotational/translational help and can
                sacrifice camera recoil and handling speed.</span></p>

    <span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c5">Important Notes:</span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c1">Grips DO NOT make a gun more accurate by manipulating bullet trajectory; instead
            they change the recoil to make shots generally travel where the player aims. Both of these facts mean that
            grips are usually obsolete on manual actions (bolt actions, pump actions, etc.), as they do not make the gun
            more accurate since the recoil will reset with each shot, and they make </span><span
            class="c1">equip</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and aim speeds worse. Grips should be used on weapons that
            fire in rapid succession, such as automatic rifles, to keep shots as close to the aimed point as possible
            and where equip and aim speeds can be sacrificed, as most &nbsp;grips do not affect the first shot
            fired.</span></p>
    <p class="c12 c15"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <h1 class="c11" id="h.89vb9oatzgsg"><span class="c5">VERTICAL GRIP</span></h1>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c1">The vertical grip acts mostly to correct rotational recoil as opposed to camera
            recoil like most other grips do. This can make the weapon feel more unstable or harder to control, and when
            paired with the somewhat misleading description in-game, can lead many people to believe that it only exists
            for hipfire. While it is not the optimal choice for most weapons to aim with, it does prove effective on
            certain others.</span></p>

    <ul class="c4 lst-kix_rhv892nsbx1e-0 start">
        <li class="c6 "><span class="c2">Positive effects include:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Decreased
                minimum and maximum rotational recoil values in both aiming and hipfire, improved hipfire spread
                damping, hipfire spread factor and slightly improved recovery speeds in aiming and hipfire.</span></li>
        <li class="c6 "><span class="c2">Negative effects include:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Increased
                minimum and maximum camera kick values in both aiming and hipfire, slower </span><span
                class="c1">equip</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and aim speeds, higher initial kick.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c1">Generally the vertical grip stands to benefit weapons that visibly sway and rotate a
            lot, or weapons that have already low camera recoil and could become even more accurate with this grip.
            Weapons that focus on hipfire can also stand to benefit from this grip. Weapons that should not use this
            grip include ones that do not visibly sway around too much and follow the camera and/or are already harder
            to handle.</span></p>

    <h1 class="c11" id="h.1f73vqd5rrnm"><span class="c5">ANGLED GRIP</span></h1>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c1">The angled grip is the cheapest camera recoil correcting grip. Its description
            focuses on its ability to help camera recoil while aiming, which is its strongest trait. Working somewhat
            like the opposite of the vertical grip, it focuses instead on correcting the camera recoil of a gun in both
            aiming and hipfire at the expense of rotational recoil.</span></p>
    <span class="c1"></span></p>
    <ul class="c4 lst-kix_rhv892nsbx1e-0">
        <li class="c6 "><span class="c2">Positive effects include:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Decreased
                minimum and maximum camera recoil values in both aiming and hipfire.</span></li>
        <li class="c6 "><span class="c2">Negative effects include:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Increased
                maximum rotational values in both aiming and hipfire, slower </span><span class="c1">equip</span><span
                class="c1">&nbsp;and aim speeds.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c1">While the angled grip does not have as many downsides as the vertical grip, it still
            faces problems and should be used with other grips in mind. For example, the folding grip is essentially
            just the angled grip, except it does everything to a more extreme degree. Stubby grip is also a significant
            competitor to the angled grip. The angled grip works best on weapons that benefit from camera recoil
            stabilization and can lose some rotational recoil accuracy at an expense, but cannot afford to lose as much
            accuracy as the folding grip makes them loose.</span></p>

    <h1 class="c11" id="h.9hksc9eqwnuv"><span class="c5">FOLDING GRIP</span></h1>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c1">The folding grip is a very extreme grip in terms of its effects, but those effects
            can be very beneficial to certain weapons. Described as a grip that focuses on camera recoil, it certainly
            lives up to its description, having the greatest overall camera recoil reduction in both aiming and hipfire.
            However, this obviously comes at a price. Its rotational recoil addition is even higher than the angled
        </span><span class="c1">grip&rsquo;s</span><span class="c1">, making it a very poor choice on many weapons. In
            addition to this, it also makes hipfire spread damping worse, making it a poor hipfire choice, but given its
            impressive camera recoil improvement, it can also be a very worthwhile grip to use on many weapons.</span>
    </p>
    <span class="c1"></span></p>
    <ul class="c4 lst-kix_rhv892nsbx1e-0">
        <li class="c6 "><span class="c2">Positive effects include:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Substantially
                decreased minimum and maximum camera recoil values in both aiming and hipfire.</span></li>
        <li class="c6 "><span class="c2">Negative effects include:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Substantially

    </ul>
    <span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c1">The folding grip can turn many jumpy-recoil weapons into much more stable ones, often
            allowing many weapons to utilize their maximum potential at range. While one should consider how much
            rotational recoil they are adding, the effects of the folding grip are often quite obvious. This grip is
            suggested for jumpy, rough-handling weapons that are still accurate for the most part, as well as weapons
            that do not rotate very much but could benefit from some form of recoil reduction</span></p>

    <h1 class="c11" id="h.7iovs4wq76r"><span class="c5">STUBBY GRIP</span></h1>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c1">The stubby grip has rather strange effects, but generally can be thought of as a grip
            focussed around improving aiming recoil. Its prime traits include its ability to reduce camera kick (in
            aiming only) to the same degree as the angled grip, but without any rotational recoil addition in both
            hipfire and aiming. Instead, the downsides of the stubby grip revolve around increasing the minimum recoil
            displacement stat in both hipfire and aiming, which is usually a better tradeoff than rotational recoil, as
            well as not helping camera recoil in hipfire and making hipfire generally worse.</span></p>
    <span class="c1"></span></p>
    <ul class="c4 lst-kix_rhv892nsbx1e-0">
        <li class="c6 "><span class="c2">Positive effects include:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Decreased
                camera recoil while aiming, improved weapon recovery speed in hipfire and aiming, slightly lower hipfire
                spread factor.</span></li>
        <li class="c6 "><span class="c2">Negative effects include:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Increased
                minimum weapon displacement in hipfire and aiming, significantly worsened hipfire spread damping, slower
            </span><span class="c1">equip</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and aim speeds.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c1">The stubby grip acts as a very aiming-based sight, working as a direct competitor to
            the angled and folding grips, as it achieves the same camera recoil reduction while aiming without the
            rotational recoil addition. It also holds some value on ranged weapons, as it improves weapon recovery
            speed, although it must be used with the translational recoil and slower aim speeds in mind, and as a result
            is not recommended for things such as dmrs. Generally the stubby grip works best for weapons that do not
            have too much to correct or require only minimal camera recoil reduction in aiming while saving the
            rotational recoil. Stubby grip is also not a good choice for hipfire weapons.</span></p>

    <p class="c7"><span class="c1">The chainsaw grip is an oddity among grips: it completely removes any ability to aim
            with your weapon. It seems to function as more of a joke than a real grip, but it does have its uses&hellip;
            sort of. As it completely removes the ability to aim, it seeks to correct hipfire as much as it can, but
            instead of focussing on rotational, translational, or camera recoil, the chainsaw grip simply improves
            hipfire spread, recovery speed, and damping by significant margins. For those of you who want to be
            &ldquo;Pro No-Scope Clippers&rdquo;, here is a grip to help you not aim and get that 360 no-scope off the
            crane (after dying 80 or so times).</span></p>

    <p class="c7"><span class="c1">The chainsaw grip is going to end up being useful for those who wish to hipfire only
            with the best possible hipfire a grip can offer. Due to its strange effects, the chainsaw grip cannot really
            be suggested or disadvised on anything because it has no real downside except to remove aiming, which is the
            same on all guns. Snipers and dmrs could use this grip if the user really wanted to, although it would make
            them largely obsolete. </span></p>

    <p class="c7"><span class="c1">The pistol grip serves much like the rival to the vertical grip, sharing many similar
            traits: both grips focus on correcting rotational recoil instead of camera recoil, as opposed to most other
            grips like stubby and folding, which correct camera recoil. From there, the pistol grip tries to gain its
            edge over the vertical grip in its aiming stability as opposed to its hipfire stability. The pistol grip
            helps rotational recoil and translational recoil in both hipfire and aiming, but helps significantly more in
            aiming. However, it also comes with a maximum camera kick penalty in both aiming and hipfire, with the
            hipfire penalty being greater than the aiming one. Generally speaking, the pistol grip works to correct
            translational and rotational recoil in aiming with a minor penalty to camera kick, but makes hipfire and
            initial kick noticeably worse at the same time.</span></p>
    <span class="c1"></span></p>
    <ul class="c4 lst-kix_rhv892nsbx1e-0">
        <li class="c6 "><span class="c2">Positive effects include:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Improved
                rotational and translational recoil in aiming, slightly improved rotational and translational recoil in
                hipfire.</span></li>
        <li class="c6 "><span class="c2">Negative effects include:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Worse spread
                damping in hipfire, slightly worse damping in aiming, worsened max camera kick, slower </span><span

    </ul>
    <span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c1">The pistol grip is certainly a helpful grip, being the optimal choice for weapons
            needing rotational recoil assistance in aiming, while focussing the negative effects on hipfire as opposed
            to camera recoil (although camera recoil in aiming takes a small penalty as well). With its main competitor
            being the vertical grip, the pistol grip is much better choice for those who want to aim primarily while
            correcting rotational/translational recoil. However, keep in mind that the vertical grip outclasses the
            pistol grip in nearly all areas in hipfire, so while the pistol grip is a better choice for aiming, the
            vertical grip makes both hipfire and aiming better (in cases where the weapon benefits from rotational
            help).</span></p>

    <p class="c7"><span class="c1">The sideways grip acts somewhat similarly to the chainsaw grip in that it aims to
            change how the user aims, but is more practical (sort of). The sideways grip adds an alternate aim option
            similar to that used on LMGs, where the user puts their weapon to the right of the screen and fires it
            without aiming down the sights (looks like firing a cannon mounted from your shoulder). The sideways grip
            also alters the recoil a little bit by making rotational recoil while aiming slightly better and making the
            max camera kick slightly worse in both hipfire and aiming, as well as slightly making the hipfire spread
            damping better. It is also unique in the sense that it has no effect on aim speed!</span></p>

            very useful on most other weapons and is outclassed by other grips easily.</span></p>

            with a built in flashlight! Aside from being a grip to replace flashlights, the potato grip is actually
            quite useful. Serving as a cross between the angled and stubby grips, the potato grip also attempts to
            correct camera recoil with minimal downside, and does a good job of it. While it may not offer the most
            camera recoil help possible, it does offer lots of it without hurting other stats very much at all.</span>

            the downsides on translational recoil, much like the stubby grip. However, instead of hurting the minimum
            possible translational recoil, it hurts the maximum possible recoil to a slightly larger degree. As a
            result, it can be thought of as a competitor to both the angled and stubby grips, as it offers the same
            camera recoil reduction in both aiming and ads, with close to the same downsides in aiming as the stubby

    <h1 class="c11" id="h.4x8qv09u3obj"><span class="c5">SKELETON GRIP</span></h1>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c1">The skeleton grip is almost like a reverse grip: it chooses to sacrifice recoil for
            aim and </span><span class="c1">equip</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;speed, and is the only grip to do so as
            of now. Because of this, it is also the only grip to be legitimately useful to many manual actions such as
            sniper rifles, shotguns, etc. This also, however, makes it largely hurtful to guns that would normally
            benefit from grips. It can also be hurtful to semi-automatic weapons, as it hurts all damping, spread, and
            recovery stats, making weapons slower to recover from recoil and overall hurting them in hipfire and aiming.
            If your weapon resets completely between shots, the skeleton grip is generally a good pick.</span></p>
    <span class="c1"></span></p>
    <ul class="c4 lst-kix_rhv892nsbx1e-0">
        <li class="c6 "><span class="c2">Positive effects include:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Improved
                equip and aim speed (and is the only grip to do so), very small improvement to hipfire spread
                factor.</span></li>
        <li class="c6 "><span class="c2">Negative effects include:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Worse
                recovery speed in aiming and hipfire, worse recoil damping in aiming and hipfire, larger crosshair and
                crosshair spread rate.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c1">The skeleton grip (as mentioned previously) works best on weapons that completely
            reset recoil between shots. Given the slower recovery speed for the weapon however, there is a risk that
            semi auto weapons like the M107 or DBV 12 might not benefit from this grip, as their overall fire rate could
            be hindered or made less accurate. Because of this, experimenting with semi auto weapons is not a bad idea
            before equipping this grip permanently on them.</span></p>

    <h1 class="c11" id="h.vrsqfz3uvjxw"><span class="c5">ROMANIAN GRIP</span></h1>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c1">The Romanian grip is an exclusive grip that can only be used on certain weapons such
            as the AK47 or Remington 870. Its main purpose is to improve hipfire by improving translational recoil and
            recovery stats. These improvements make the weapon&rsquo;s hipfire easier to manage, as the Romanian grip
            does not affect camera recoil stats like the vertical grip does. However, the Romanian grip does negatively
            affect rotational recoil, and to a substantial amount. It also hurts aiming speed even more than most other
            grips, making it a poor choice for manual actions or ranged weapons.</span></p>
    <span class="c1"></span></p>
    <ul class="c4 lst-kix_rhv892nsbx1e-0">
        <li class="c6 "><span class="c2">Positive effects include:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Improved
                hipfire spread, recovery, and damping values, improved minimum translational recoil in hipfire, improved
                min and max translational recoil in aiming.</span></li>
        <li class="c6 "><span class="c2">Negative effects include:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Worse
                rotational recoil in aiming and hipfire, slower </span><span class="c1">equip</span><span
                class="c1">&nbsp;speeds, even slower aim speeds than other grips.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c1">As the Romanian grip is not available on all weapons, the weapons it can help are
            very limited. The Romanian grip ends up being a competitor with the vertical grip for the title of best
            hipfire grip, but only for the certain weapons that can have it. It becomes useful on things like the AK47,
            as it has a naturally high camera recoil and suffers from the downsides of the vertical grip even more, but
            can afford the downsides the Romanian grip brings. Keep in mind that the Romanian grip is largely for
            hipfire and generally makes aiming recoil worse, and as such should be used with preference and
            caution.</span></p>

    <h1 class="c11" id="h.fydjvuym06k3"><span class="c5">HERA CQR GRIP</span></h1>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c1">The Hera CQR grip (or Hera grip for the sake of ease) is another grip exclusive to
            only certain guns. Much like the Romanian grip, it is also slower to aim than other grips, but in the Hera
            grip&rsquo;s case, it is also slower to equip, making it even slower than the Romanian grip. However, the
            Hera grip has a built-in exclusive yellow laser! Aside from its unique laser, it also holds some unique
            stats. Working somewhat like a pistol grip with a free laser, the Hera grip improves rotational and
            translational recoil in both hipfire and aiming, at the cost of camera recoil in both, just like the pistol
            grip.</span></p>
    <span class="c1"></span></p>
    <ul class="c4 lst-kix_rhv892nsbx1e-0">
        <li class="c6 "><span class="c2">Positive effects include:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Improved
                translational and rotational recoil (only improves max values in hipfire), slightly improved hipfire
                damping and weapon recovery speed, special integrated yellow laser.</span></li>
        <li class="c6 "><span class="c2">Negative effects include:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Worse max
                camera recoil in hipfire and aiming, worse camera recovery speed, worse aiming walk speed, even slower
                aim and equip speeds than other grips.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c1">With a very heavy set of pros and cons, the Hera grip should be used with careful
            consideration. While it does have the same camera recoil downsides as the pistol grip, it also makes the
            weapon handling generally slower than the pistol grip (or any other grip) does. So why use the Hera grip
            over the pistol grip? While the pistol grip may have better rotational and translational improvement in
            aiming, as well as not making recovery speeds worse, the Hera grip is able to accomplish close to the same
            goal while not making hipfire much worse (and in many cases improving the hipfire). Because the grip has an
            integrated laser, and because of its slow handling, the Hera grip acts like a pistol grip suited for
            hipfire, but not completely useless in aiming, offering a unique balance of the 2 forms of firing the
            weapon. In short, the Hera grip is good for weapons that need rotational/translational help and can
            sacrifice camera recoil and handling speed.</span></p>
